# 2.1 : 
Theoretically the rate of convergence follows Bisection method and false positive = 1(linear) , Newton Raphson = 2(Quadratic) and secant method = 1.62. However, in practice, the observed order of convergence can vary depending on several factors such as the function being solved, the initial guesses, and numerical precision. The computed values of Iterations and Order is printed for different functions using different methods.
# 2.2 : 
ytm_newton_raphson uses the Newton-Raphson method to iteratively find the YTM. It adjusts the YTM guess based on the price difference and the derivative of the bond pricing formula
